\par In 1995, Goemans and Williamson made a significant breakthrough that has not yet been improved upon. Their algorithm returns a cut with a weight of at least .878 times the weight of the true maximum cut.\cite{GW} \\

\par Recall the function that gives the weight of a cut $(S,\bar{S})$ is $$w(S,\bar{S}) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} w_{ij}(1-y_iy_j).$$ Noting that $y_i$ and $y_j$ can be considered unit vectors in $\mathbb{R}^1$, Goemans and Williamson ``relax'' the max-cut problem by swapping out $y_i$ and $y_j$ for unit vectors $\vec{v}_i$ and $\vec{v}_j$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the graph. Maximizing the new objective function $f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} w_{ij}(1 - \vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_j)$ is a simpler task because it is a \textit{semi-definite program}.\\

\par Let $X$ be the matrix with $\vec{v}_i$ in the $i$th column, $1 \le i \le n$, and let $Y = X^T X$. Then $Y$ is positive semi-definite, meaning $\vec{v} X^T \vec{v} \ge 0$ for all $\vec{v} \in \mathbb{R}^n$.\cite{GW} Since entry $y_{ij} = \vec{v}_i \cdot \vec{v}_j$, we obtain a new objective function: $$f(x) = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i<j} w_{ij}(1 - y_{ij}).$$ Let $Z^*$ be the value of this function applied to a solution set of vectors. While the problem of maximizing $Z^*$ is not in $P$, we can pick a small constant $\epsilon > 0$ and find a solution with value $Z^* - \epsilon$ in polynomial time. The upper bound on running time depends only on $n, \epsilon,$ and the sum of the weights $w_{ij}$.\cite{GW} \\

\par After finding the optimal set of vectors using an algorithm for the semi-definite program, randomly select a new vector $\hat{r}$ that passes through the origin of $\mathbb{R}^n$. Then let $S := \{i|v_i\cdot \hat{r} \ge 0\}$. In other words, $\hat{r}$ is normal to a hyperplane in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and all the vectors above the plane are in $S$ while all the vectors below are in $\bar{S}$. As Goemans and Williamson prove, the expected weight of the resulting cut $(S,\bar{S})$ is at least $\alpha(Z^* - \epsilon)$, where $\alpha = min_{0\le \theta \le \pi} \frac{2}{\pi}\frac{\theta}{1-\cos{\theta}} > 0.878$.\cite{GW} \\
