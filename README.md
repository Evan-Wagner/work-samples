# My Work Samples

## Programming

- When the Kenyon College Writing Center moved online due to COVID, I created an automated sign-up and logging system for remote appointments. After the school returned to in-person learning, I added functionality for in-person appointments as well.
  - Designed a spreadsheet with two displays: an interactive calendar where students could sign up for appointments, and a log of information about previous appointments
  - Automated the process of logging appointments, emailing relevant parties, cancelling appointments, and substituting consultants for specific shifts using Google's [Apps Script API](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/blob/main/writing-center-log-API/writing-center-log-API.js)


## Statistics

- I applied logistic regression techniques to a 2017 live-caller opinion survey to explore belief in human-caused climate change among U.S. adults.
  - Built models and produced figures with an [R script](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/climate_logistic_regression.R)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/climate_logistic_regression.pdf)


- Using a dataset of all documented fatal police encounters from the year 2015, I compared nonparametric (distribution-free) statistical methods to their more common normality-assuming counterparts.
  - Analyzed data and produced figures with an [R script](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/police_killings_nonparametric.R)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/police_killings_nonparametric.pdf)


## Applied Linear Algebra

- I wrote my capstone paper for Kenyon College's Mathematics major on the linear algebra underlying waveform filters used in music production.
  - Produced figures and audio with [MATLAB](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/linear_algebra_music_filters.m)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/linear_algebra_music_filters.pdf)
