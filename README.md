## Work samples

- I used logistic regression techniques on data from a 2017 live-caller survey to predict belief in human-caused climate change among U.S. adults.
- Using a dataset of all documented fatal police encounters from the year 2015, I compared distribution-free statistical methods to their more common counterparts, which assume variables are normally distributed.
