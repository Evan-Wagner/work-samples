# My Work Samples

## Statistics

- I applied logistic regression techniques to a 2017 live-caller opinion survey to explore belief in human-caused climate change among U.S. adults.
  - Built models and produced figures with an [R script](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/climate-logistic-regression.R)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/climate-logistic-regression/climate-logistic-regression.pdf)


- Using a dataset of all documented fatal police encounters from the year 2015, I compared nonparametric (distribution-free) statistical methods to their more common normality-assuming counterparts.
  - Analyzed data and produced figures with an [R script](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/police-killings-nonparametric.R)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/police-killings-nonparametric/police-killings-nonparametric.pdf)


## Applied Linear Algebra

- I wrote my capstone paper for Kenyon College's Mathematics major on the linear algebra underlying waveform filters used in music production.
  - Produced figures and audio with [MATLAB](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/linear-algebra-music-filters.m)
  - Wrote the paper in [Overleaf](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/overleaf-project)
  - Compiled the paper to a [PDF](https://github.com/Evan-Wagner/work-samples/tree/main/linear-algebra-music-filters/linear-algebra-music-filters.pdf)
