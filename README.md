# My Work Samples

## Statistics

- I applied logistic regression techniques to a 2017 live-caller opinion survey to explore belief in human-caused climate change among U.S. adults.
- Using a dataset of all documented fatal police encounters from the year 2015, I compared nonparametric (distribution-free) statistical methods to their more common normality-assuming counterparts.

## Applied Linear Algebra

- I wrote my capstone paper for Kenyon College's Mathematics major on the linear algebra underlying waveform filters used in music production.
